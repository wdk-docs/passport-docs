# Sign Up

In the previous section, you added sign out and now have an app that allows users to both sign in and sign out. Only one feature remains. In this section, you'll add a signup page that allows users to create an account.

Open 'routes/auth.js' and add the following route at line 52, below the '/logout' route.

```js
router.get("/signup", function (req, res, next) {
  res.render("signup");
});
```

This route will render the signup page. Add an HTML form to that page which will prompt the user to create a new account with their preferred username and password.

Open 'views/signup.ejs' and add the form at line 15, below the "Sign up" heading.

```html
<h1>Sign up</h1>
<form action="/signup" method="post">
  <section>
    <label for="username">Username</label>
    <input
      id="username"
      name="username"
      type="text"
      autocomplete="username"
      required
    />
  </section>
  <section>
    <label for="new-password">Password</label>
    <input
      id="new-password"
      name="password"
      type="password"
      autocomplete="new-password"
      required
    />
  </section>
  <button type="submit">Sign up</button>
</form>
```

Finally, add a route that will handle the form submission when the user clicks "Sign up." Back within 'routes/auth.js', add the following route at line 56, below the '/signup' route.

```js
router.post("/signup", function (req, res, next) {
  var salt = crypto.randomBytes(16);
  crypto.pbkdf2(
    req.body.password,
    salt,
    310000,
    32,
    "sha256",
    function (err, hashedPassword) {
      if (err) {
        return next(err);
      }
      db.run(
        "INSERT INTO users (username, hashed_password, salt) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
        [req.body.username, hashedPassword, salt],
        function (err) {
          if (err) {
            return next(err);
          }
          var user = {
            id: this.lastID,
            username: req.body.username,
          };
          req.login(user, function (err) {
            if (err) {
              return next(err);
            }
            res.redirect("/");
          });
        }
      );
    }
  );
});
```

This route creates a new user record in the app's database, storing the username and hashed password. Once the record is created, the user is logged in.

Return to the app and create a new account.

You have built an app that allows users to sign up, sign in, and sign out!
