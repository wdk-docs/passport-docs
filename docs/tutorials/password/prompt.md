# Login Prompt

To let users sign in with a username and password, the app needs a page which prompts the user to enter their credentials. In this section, you'll add a signin page.

Create a file that will contain authentication-related routes.

```sh
$ touch routes/auth.js
```

Add the following code to that file, which creates a route that will render the signin page.

```js
var express = require("express");

var router = express.Router();

router.get("/login", function (req, res, next) {
  res.render("login");
});

module.exports = router;
```

Next, add these routes to the app. Open 'app.js' and require() the newly created auth routes at line 10, below where 'routes/index' is require()'d.

```js
var indexRouter = require('./routes/index');
var authRouter = require('./routes/auth');
Continuing within 'app.js', use() the newly require()'d authRouter at line 27, below where indexRouter is use()'d.

app.use('/', indexRouter);
app.use('/', authRouter);
```

The signin page has been added to the app! See how it looks by starting the server.

```sh
$ npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and click "Sign in." You are prompted to sign in, but there's no place to enter a username and password.

Add an HTML form which will allow the user to input their credentials. Open 'views/login.ejs' and add a form at line 15, below the "Sign in" heading.

```html
<h1>Sign in</h1>
<form action="/login/password" method="post">
  <section>
    <label for="username">Username</label>
    <input
      id="username"
      name="username"
      type="text"
      autocomplete="username"
      required
      autofocus
    />
  </section>
  <section>
    <label for="current-password">Password</label>
    <input
      id="current-password"
      name="password"
      type="password"
      autocomplete="current-password"
      required
    />
  </section>
  <button type="submit">Sign in</button>
</form>
```

Refresh the page. The app now has a signin page that prompts the user for their username and password. Next, you will verify the username and password.
