# Twitter

Log in with Twitter allows users to sign in using their Twitter account. Support for Log in with Twitter is provided by the passport-twitter package.

## Install

To install passport-twitter, execute the following command:

```sh
$ npm install passport-twitter
```

## Configure

Before your application can make use of Log in with Twitter, you must register your app with Twitter. This can be done in the Apps dashboard at Twitter Developer Platform. Once registered, your app will be issued an API key and secret which will be used in the strategy configuration.

The following code is an example that configures and registers the TwitterStrategy:

```js
var passport = require('passport')
var TwitterStrategy = require('passport-twitter');

passport.use(new TwitterStrategy({
consumerKey: process.env['TWITTER_API_KEY'],
consumerSecret: process.env['TWITTER_API_SECRET'],
callbackURL: 'http://www.example.com/oauth/callback/twitter'
},
function(token, tokenSecret, profile, done) {
db.get('SELECT * FROM federated_credentials WHERE provider = ? AND subject = ?', [
'https://twitter.com',
profile.id
], function(err, cred) {
if (err) { return cb(err); }
if (!cred) {
// The Twitter account has not logged in to this app before. Create
// new user record and link it to the Twitter account.
db.run('INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (?)', [
profile.displayName
], function(err) {
if (err) { return cb(err); }

          var id = this.lastID;
          db.run('INSERT INTO federated_credentials (user_id, provider, subject) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', [
            id,
            'https://twitter.com',
            profile.id
          ], function(err) {
            if (err) { return cb(err); }
            var user = {
              id: id.toString(),
              name: profile.displayName
            };
            return cb(null, user);
          });
        });
      } else {
        // The Twitter account has previously logged in to the app.  Get the
        // user record linked to the Twitter account and log the user in.
        db.get('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [ cred.user_id ], function(err, user) {
          if (err) { return cb(err); }
          if (!user) { return cb(null, false); }
          return cb(null, user);
        });
      }
    };

}
));
```

The options to the TwitterStrategy constructor must include a consumerKey and consumerSecret, the values of which are set to the API key and secret that were obtained when registering your application. A callbackURL must also be included. Twitter will redirect users to this location after they have authenticated. The path of this URL must match the route defined below.

The verify function accepts a token, tokenSecret and profile as arguments. token and tokenSecret are used for API access, and are not needed for authentication. profile is a normalized profile containing information provided by Twitter about the user who is signing in.

The verify function is responsible for determining the user to which the Twitter account belongs. The first time that account is used to sign in, a new user record is typically created automatically using profile information supplied by Twitter, and that record is then linked to the Twitter account. On subsequent signins, the existing user record will be found via its relation to the Twitter account.

Linking social accounts to a user record is recommended, as it allows users to link multiple social accounts from other providers in the event that they stop using Twitter. Alternatively, the user could set up a credential, such as a password, for their user account at your app. Either feature allows the user to continue to sign in to your application independent of their Twitter account.

The example above illustrates usage of a SQL database to find or create a user record and link it to a Twitter account. However, because the verify function is supplied by the application, the application is free to use a database and schema of its choosing.

Internally, Log in with Twitter is implemented using OAuth 1.0a. As such, the strategy configuration is able to make use of additional options and functionality provided by the base OAuth strategy.

## Prompt

Place a button on the application's login page, prompting the user to sign in with Twitter.

```html
<a href="/login/twitter" class="button">Sign in with Twitter</a>
```

Define a route that, when the button is clicked, will redirect the user to Twitter, where they will authenticate.

```js
app.get("/login/twitter", passport.authenticate("twitter"));
```

## Authenticate

After the user has authenticated with Twitter, they will be redirected back to your application. Define a route which will handle this redirect.

```js
app.get(
  "/oauth/callback/twitter",
  passport.authenticate("twitter", {
    failureRedirect: "/login",
    failureMessage: true,
  }),
  function (req, res) {
    res.redirect("/");
  }
);
```

When a request to this route is processed, the strategy will authenticate the fact that the user signed in with Twitter and obtain that user's profile information. If authentication succeeds, passport.authenticate() middleware calls the next function in the stack. In this example, the function is redirecting the authenticated user to the home page.

When authentication fails, the user is re-prompted to sign in and informed that their initial attempt was not successful. This is accomplished by using the failureRedirect option, which will redirect the user to the login page, along with the failureMessage option which will add the message to req.session.messages.

The path of this route should be the value supplied for the callbackURL option in the strategy configuration above.
