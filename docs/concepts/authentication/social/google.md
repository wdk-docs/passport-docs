### Google

Sign In With Google allows users to sign in using their Google account. Support for Sign In With Google is provided by the passport-google-oidc package.

#### Install

To install passport-google-oidc, execute the following command:

```sh
$ npm install passport-google-oidc
```

#### Configure

Before your application can make use of Sign In With Google, you must register your app with Google. This can be done in the APIs & Services page of the Google Cloud Platform console. Once registered, your app will be issued a client ID and secret which will be used in the strategy configuration.

The following code is an example that configures and registers the GoogleStrategy:

```js
var passport = require('passport');
var GoogleStrategy = require('passport-google-oidc');

passport.use(new GoogleStrategy({
clientID: process.env['GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'],
clientSecret: process.env['GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET'],
callbackURL: 'https://www.example.com/oauth2/redirect/google'
},
function(issuer, profile, cb) {
db.get('SELECT * FROM federated_credentials WHERE provider = ? AND subject = ?', [
issuer,
profile.id
], function(err, cred) {
if (err) { return cb(err); }
if (!cred) {
// The Google account has not logged in to this app before. Create a
// new user record and link it to the Google account.
db.run('INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (?)', [
profile.displayName
], function(err) {
if (err) { return cb(err); }

          var id = this.lastID;
          db.run('INSERT INTO federated_credentials (user_id, provider, subject) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', [
            id,
            issuer,
            profile.id
          ], function(err) {
            if (err) { return cb(err); }
            var user = {
              id: id.toString(),
              name: profile.displayName
            };
            return cb(null, user);
          });
        });
      } else {
        // The Google account has previously logged in to the app.  Get the
        // user record linked to the Google account and log the user in.
        db.get('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [ cred.user_id ], function(err, user) {
          if (err) { return cb(err); }
          if (!user) { return cb(null, false); }
          return cb(null, user);
        });
      }
    };

}
));
```

The options to the GoogleStrategy constructor must include a clientID and clientSecret, the values of which are set to the client ID and secret that were obtained when registering your application. A callbackURL must also be included. Google will redirect users to this location after they have authenticated. The path of this URL must match the route defined below.

The verify function accepts issuer and profile as arguments. issuer is set to "https://accounts.google.com", indicating that the user signed in with Google. profile is a normalized profile containing information provided by Google about the user who is signing in.

The verify function is responsible for determining the user to which the Google account belongs. The first time that account is used to sign in, a new user record is typically created automatically using profile information supplied by Google, and that record is then linked to the Google account. On subsequent signins, the existing user record will be found via its relation to the Google account.

Linking social accounts to a user record is recommended, as it allows users to link multiple social accounts from other providers in the event that they stop using Google. Alternatively, the user could set up a credential, such as a password, for their user account at your app. Either feature allows the user to continue to sign in to your application independent of their Google account.

The example above illustrates usage of a SQL database to find or create a user record and link it to a Google account. However, because the verify function is supplied by the application, the application is free to use a database and schema of its choosing.

Internally, Sign In With Google is implemented using OpenID Connect. As such, the strategy configuration is able to make use of additional options and functionality provided by the base OpenID Connect strategy.

#### Prompt

Place a button on the application's login page, prompting the user to sign in with Google.

```html
<a href="/login/google" class="button">Sign in with Google</a>
```

Define a route that, when the button is clicked, will redirect the user to Google, where they will authenticate.

```js
app.get('/login/google', passport.authenticate('google'));
If your application needs additional information about the user, that can be requested with the scope option:

app.get('/login/google', passport.authenticate('google', {
scope: [ 'email' ]
}));
```

#### Authenticate

After the user has authenticated with Google, they will be redirected back to your application. Define a route which will handle this redirect.

```js
app.get(
  "/oauth2/redirect/google",
  passport.authenticate("google", {
    failureRedirect: "/login",
    failureMessage: true,
  }),
  function (req, res) {
    res.redirect("/");
  }
);
```

When a request to this route is processed, the strategy will authenticate the fact that the user signed in with Google and obtain that user's profile information. If authentication succeeds, passport.authenticate() middleware calls the next function in the stack. In this example, the function is redirecting the authenticated user to the home page.

When authentication fails, the user is re-prompted to sign in and informed that their initial attempt was not successful. This is accomplished by using the failureRedirect option, which will redirect the user to the login page, along with the failureMessage option which will add the message to req.session.messages.

The path of this route should be the value supplied for the callbackURL option in the strategy configuration above.
